# Cloud Native Asturias Website
The official website for Cloud Native Asturias [cloudnativeasturias.com](https://cloudnativeasturias.com).

## Join us
Whether you're an individual or a professional, passionate or simply curious about technology, please reach out to us. We are a non-profit organisation that aims at elevating the Asturian technological landscape through world-wide collaboration and we definitely need you.

Our organisation sits at the table of dozens of similar internationals organisations which come together to create the biggest world-wide network of Cloud Native professionals. Join us, and help us to bring back to Asturias the opportunities that have always been neglected to us. Join us, and you'll have a chance to gain visibility, exposure and credibility while you do something for your homeland.

## Support us
If you represent an institution from Asturias that focuses on new technology, Digital Innovation, or Cloud Native technologies this is an opportunity to leverage your international outlook. Together, we'll be able to send a stronger message so that the international community (especially the one on the digital sector) sees the potential that our Asturian Technological hub can offer. We can't remain local and unseen anymore. Asturias must develop its international outlook, and we know what's needs to be done for the Asturian professional (inside and outside Asturias) but we can't do it alone.

As a non-profit organisation our first and foremost objective is to engage your institution as a non-economical supporter. Although money will be required to organise events, that's not the primary focus. Instead, the Cloud Native Asturias foundation seeks to join all Asturian institutions together so that we can send the strongest message to our international audience. We are prepared, we are ready, so they only need to see us in action.
